            Sometimes conferences and institutes are officially located in a
            little-known place, but their location is widely known as being in
            a major neighboring city.  In this way, we can store information
            about both the technically correct but little-known place and the
            well-known but technically incorrect place.

            The cities should be ordered from most specific to least specific.

            :example: ``["Batavia", "Chicago"]``

            Name of the specific place where this is located.

            - For a Conference record, this could be an institution or a hotel

              :example: ``Dan Panorama hotel``

            - For an Institution record representing an independent institute
              and not a department, this could be a university where it is
              located.

              :MARC: Not present.
              :example: ``U. Libre Brussels``
